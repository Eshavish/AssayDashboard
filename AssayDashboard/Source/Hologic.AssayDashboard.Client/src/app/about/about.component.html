                <p>AssayDashboard helps provide cutting edge technology to users increasing overall performance of the system.
                    The application has four sub-applications namely Curve Repository, Assay Viewer, Report Repository and
                    Run Export. These work to serve different purposes. These applications are an indispensable part of the
                    Panther fusion, with regards to the functionality they provide. <br><b>Assay Viewer:</b> Assay Definition
                    files play an integral role in the Panther Fusion system and are widely used by Hologic’s software team.
                    The files are defined in XML format, which makes the viewing of the files challenging and time consuming.
                    The Assay Viewer aims to give a more user friendly experience to anyone who works directly with ADF’s.
                    <br><b>Report repo:</b> Hologic requires the reports generated from the Panther fusion system to be stored
                    centrally for global access. Once the repository has report files, it could be used to search a specific
                    one instead of inter-department communication, conserving time and manual efforts. The repo would act
                    as a hub to manipulate, update or view information along with supported sharing and distribution.We are
                    Hologic.
                    <br><b>Curve repo:</b> Application allows a centralized place for all the curve files and can look up files
                    by certain attributes which saves time tremenously compared to before when user had to manually open up the file and look
                    for specific information, such as assay. 
                    <br><b>Run Export:</b>
                    After each run of the panther, the export file generated will contain a lot of information that could be couple
                    thousand lines long, so this application will help the user by displaying most useful information using friendly User Interface.

    <h5> Assay Viewer</h5>
    <h6 class="assaydashboard-text">
        <p>
            <b>Ruben Ramirez</b><br> The Assay Viewer allows users to import or drag and drop assay definition files, the application
            then parses and displays the extracted data into a user interface. The web application also runs a cyclic redundancy
            check(CRC) on the file, as means of validation. Users are given the ability to update the CRC value in the case
            that an ADF has an invalid value.Hologic employees can use the application to have a more user friendly experience
            when viewing assay files. The application generates a report-like interface that displays information about the
            calibrators, controls, reagents, result categories, and process steps defined in the ADF.<br> <br>Contact: Ruben.Ramirez@hologic.com

            <b>Esha Vishwakarma</b><br> The application presents a report repository for the users to upload, search, view and download
            reports from a centralized location.The application saves time and increases efficiency of the whole system by
            consuming less time to locate reports, upload batch reports or view on a remote system. It helps contribute towards

            <b>Paul Choi</b><br>Curve Repo Application will allow user to freely upload curve files with certain tag associated with it, as well as,
            indicate if the curve is a known curve file, and user can search for specific curve file with tag, assay, assay versions, and software versions.
            User can also view live graph of the curve for only TCYC and .Curve files. Application provides useful tool such as statistics about 
            what is in the database with user friendly UI.<br><br> Contact: Paul.Choi@hologic.com
